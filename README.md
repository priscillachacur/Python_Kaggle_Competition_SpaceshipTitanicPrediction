##SpaceshipTitanicPrediction


This repository hosts a detailed analysis for the Kaggle competition "Spaceship Titanic", (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) focusing on predicting which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. The project leverages Python, machine learning, and regression models to dissect the dataset and develop predictions. Key tasks include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of sophisticated predictive models. The objective is to generate insights and predictions that contribute to a worldwide ranking leaderboard, based on the accuracy of test data validation. This project not only aims to achieve a high placement on the leaderboard but also to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the transportation phenomenon observed on the Spaceship Titanic.
